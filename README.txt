## tic tac toe with computer logic

website inspo from: https://www.codebrainer.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-javascript-game
compter logic inspo from: https://codepen.io/lando464/pen/BPGEKO (logic flawed)
javascript function inspo: https://github.com/david-reid/cwd-endscreen-session/blob/master/index.html (game doesn't work propperly)

much better example: https://codepen.io/Mihalache/pen/MVOBeV - however computer logic can be optimised, computer most often starts first (better to alternate) and always goes for a corner (better to randomize starting )

want to make the game mostly look like this
https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-tic-tac-toe

what to keep and what to modify:

front page
keep: title, board selection, single player, multiplayer
mod: single player is against AI

game page
mod: no normal or hard mode, 



intialise game with selection
can select who plays first
whoever goes first is the X

create start screen
show game - show game on the fly
end game screen with winner and restart game
