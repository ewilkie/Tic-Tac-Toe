# Tic Tac Toe

My main aim for this project was to expand on my DOM manipulation skills using plain JS without replying too heavily on any particular tutorial.

The computer logic is currently set to select a random cell independent of the player position.
This means its incredibly easy to beat the PC as this stage.

User is able to select symbol which determines who goes first. This is handled by the goFirst variable, which triggers alternating moves from player and pc until winning combination.
The two pawns/symbols in this game X and O are coded into the html and display toggled inside JS.
